# PyTorch Graph Breaks Analysis

This directory contains analysis and solutions for handling graph breaks in PyTorch's `torch.compile` functionality, as demonstrated in `working_torch_compile.ipynb`.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros of Our Approach

1. **Performance Gains**: Successfully eliminating graph breaks can yield 2-10x speedups
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Compiled graphs often use less memory than eager execution
3. **Portability**: Solutions work across different hardware (CUDA, CPU, etc.)
4. **Maintainability**: Cleaner code structure with explicit compilation boundaries
5. **Debugging**: Better visibility into performance bottlenecks

### Cons and Limitations

1. **Development Overhead**: Refactoring code to avoid graph breaks requires time and expertise
2. **Complexity**: Some solutions introduce additional code complexity
3. **Compatibility**: Not all PyTorch features work well with compilation
4. **Debugging Difficulty**: Compiled code can be harder to debug than eager mode
5. **Version Dependency**: Solutions may need updates as PyTorch evolves

## Best Practices

1. Start with `torch._dynamo.explain()` to identify all graph breaks
2. Address the most performance-critical breaks first
3. Use `torch.compile(fullgraph=True)` during development to catch all breaks
4. Consider using `torch._dynamo.optimize("inductor")` for more control
5. Benchmark before and after fixing each break to measure impact
6. Keep eager-mode fallbacks for debugging purposes
