# Memory-Efficient Backpropagation for LLMs

This directory contains an implementation of memory-efficient linear layers and backpropagation for large language models, as demonstrated in `mem_ef_backprop_v4.ipynb`.

## Pros and Cons

### Advantages

1. **Memory Efficiency**: 62.1% VRAM reduction enables training with larger batch sizes
2. **Numerical Stability**: Maintains gradient accuracy within acceptable tolerances
3. **Flexibility**: Compatible with various loss functions (CE, MSE, etc.)
4. **Type Preservation**: Works with mixed precision training (bfloat16/float16)
5. **Dynamic Chunking**: Adjustable chunk sizes for different hardware constraints

### Limitations

1. **Computational Overhead**: Slightly increased computation time due to chunked processing
2. **Implementation Complexity**: More complex than standard linear layers
3. **Gradient Accumulation**: Requires careful handling of gradient normalization
4. **Custom Integration**: Needs specific integration with model architecture
